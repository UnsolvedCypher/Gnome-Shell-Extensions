Extensions for Gnome Shell. I currently support version 3.2. My current extensions are:

RemovePanelAppMenu: this removes the menu that shows the current application's name; it sits next to the "Activities" button.

To install the extensions:
 - get it from GIT
 - put the extension's directory (the one with the '@' in the name) in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
 - restart the shell (Alt+F2 and type r then hit enter)
 - enable it using gnome-tweak-tool
