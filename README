Extensions for Gnome Shell. I currently support version 3.2. My current extensions are:

 * RemovePanelAppMenu: this removes the menu that shows the current application's name; it sits next to the "Activities" button.
 * DockClickFix: this extension "fixes" the dash's default behavior when you click on an icon. The defualt is to launch the app if none is running and to switch to the current instance if it is already running. This extension changes that to instead of switching to it if it is already running it always launches a new instance.

To install the extensions:
 - get it from GIT
 - put the extension's directory (the one with the '@' in the name) in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
 - restart the shell (Alt+F2 and type r then hit enter)
 - enable it using gnome-tweak-tool
